# Payment Gateway Integration  

This project demonstrates a simple **Payment Gateway** interface that can be integrated into any website. It allows users to securely input their card details, generate an OTP (One-Time Password) for payment verification, and confirms the payment upon successful OTP entry.  

## Features  
- **Card Details Form**: Users can enter their card number, expiry date, and CVV for processing payments.  
- **OTP Generation**: A randomly generated 6-digit OTP is displayed in a secure popup, simulating a payment authentication process.  
- **OTP Verification**: Users can input the OTP to verify and complete the payment process.  
- **Payment Confirmation**: A message is displayed upon successful verification, indicating that the payment has been processed.  

## Project Highlights  
- Designed with a clean and minimal user interface using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
- Client-side functionality implemented using **JavaScript**, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.  
- Built to simulate the basic flow of a payment process, making it a beginner-friendly project for learning purposes.  

## Use Cases  
This project is ideal for:  
- Developers looking to understand the basics of integrating a payment system into their websites.  
- Showcasing in portfolios as an example of implementing interactive web features.  
- Demonstrating the OTP-based payment flow for educational purposes.
